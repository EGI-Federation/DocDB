<center><h1>DocDB Security Considerations</h1></center>
<p>

Security for DocDB is determined by three sets of permissions:
<ol>
<li>  File level  permissions <br>
      Depending on your installation, these may include both 
      UNIX style permissions and AFS group directory permissions.
<li>  Web permissions
<li>  MySQL permissions
</ol>

<p>
Generally, for CD websites, to administer DocDB you need to have rlidwka for
the Nicholls:www_cd_docdb group in AFS space.  Files will need rwxr-xr-x
(755) permissions to be executable by the web server.

<p>


Web permissions are controlled using the .htaccess file method.  The
.htaccess fiel is placed in the same cgi-bin diretory from which the DocDB
scripts are executed.  In our implementation, that
is ./docdb/cgi-bin/xxx-private, where xxx is the DocDB instance name.  The
contents of the .htaccess file should be as follows:
<p>

AuthType Basic <br>

AuthName "PasswordRequired" <br>

AuthUserFile <br>

"afs/fnal.gov/files/expwww/computing/home/docdb/auth/.htpasswd" <br>

Require valid-user <br>

<p>


Note the AuthUserFile location.  To allow independent instances to have
their own security, another filename may be used, i.e., .osgpasswd."  In
that case, a .htaccess file must be placed in the xxx_private directory of
the instance, replacing the symbolic link, and the AuthUserFile filename
must be changed to match.
<p>
The htpassword command may be found at:
/afs/fnal.gov/files/expwww/computing/home/docdb/auth/htpasswd/bin/htpasswd.

To create a password file, cd to the directory in which the AuthUserFile
resides (which is specified in the .htaccess file).   Run the following
command:
<ul>
<li>htpasswd/bin/htpasswd -c .xxxpasswd username
</ul>
where username is the name of a read/write user for the xxx instance of
DocDB.
<p>
To add a user to an existing password file, use this command:
<ul>
<li>htpasswd/bin/htpasswd xxxpasswd username
</ul>
 To change the password of an existing user, use the command above.  Users
may be copied and pasted between .xxxpasswd files.
<p>
All instances of DocDB maintained by the CD Web group should have the
docdbadm and cdweb usernames.
<p>
The DocDB administrator (docdbadm in our case) must then log on to the DocDB
instance and add the users created in the .htpasswd file.  These users are
stored in the "SecurityGroups" table of the MySQL database associated with
the DocDB instance.
<p>
Within DocDB groups may be subordinate to other groups.  A dominant group
assumes all the privileges of a subordinate group.  Thus, all groups must be
made subordinate to docdbadm and all local groups are made subordinate to
cdweb.  This is done through the administrative functions of DocDB.
<p>
Never create documents as docdbadm or choose that group when creating
documents.  Only use docdbadm for administrative functions that cannot be
done as cdweb or the instance user.
<p>
Finally, we come to MySQL permissions.
<p>
MySQL maintains its own permissions independent of DocDB, web and file
system permissions.  There are three important accounts for DocDB purposes,
as well as the MySQL root account:
<ol>
  <li> docdbadm - administrative account for a particular document database.
This is the account whose password you must type in DocDB when performing
administrative functions.  It is also used when directly manipulating the
database.
  <li> docdbrw - used for all write functions which modify the database.
  <li> docdbro - used for public access to the database, when modification of
the database is not possible.
</ol>
The "root" account is used to set up new databases and set access
permissions for the other three accounts.

<p>
In MySQL there is a default database named "mysql" which contains the
security information for th edatabase server and each database on that
server.  To use root, you must access the database from localhost only,
meaning using a secure SSH or Telnet connection (Kerberos) to connect to the
machine hosting MySQL (flxd01.fnal.gov).
<p>
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE MYSQL SECURITY SETTINGS UNLESS YOU ARE SURE
ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
<p>
docdbadm may connect to MySQL using a MySQL client from any machine in the
fnal.gov domain.  Nothing outside of this domain is permitted access.  If
you need to use docdbadm from a remote location, you must connect using the
Fermilab VPN.
<p>
docdbrw and docdbro may access the database from any domain.
<p>
The docdbrw and dodbro usernames and passwords are explicitly contained in
the CGI Perl script ProjectGlobals.pm.  This is how the scripts are able to
access the database.
<p>
Docdbadm and its password are NOT in the scripts.  This is why you must type
the administrator password every time you make an administrative change.
<p>
For convenience, the username docdbadm is the same for both the web
interface for DocDB and the MySQL database.  They DO NOT HAVE TO BE THE
SAME.  However, more typing would be required when using the administrator
account.
