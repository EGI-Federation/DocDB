Database structures allow for a number of things that aren't currently supported
by the code:

* Hiding major topics from groups (GroupTopic table)

* Associating an author with personal accounts (AuthorID in EmailUser)

* Restricting who is allowed to sign documents (CanSign in EmailUser)

* More info on "Your Account" Page:

1. What groups you have membership in

2. Whether you have sign off privileges

3. What your email notification preferences are

4. Links to changing your email notification preferences (or the capability to change them right there)

5. A mailto link to DocDB administrators in order to get sign off or security group membership changed.

* Remove add files button on reserved ShowDocument

* Remove "None" from topics, files in meeting list(?)

* Login popup if certifcate is more than one group. Can choose groups to use.

* Move ListDocuments in scripts area to DocumentTable

* SelectEmailPrefs problems

2. SelectEmailPrefs - once I hit Update, I just go back to the top of the page
(when I expect to get a page that says my update was successful like I do for
most DocDB operations) - not a big deal.

2b.  Hmmm. I did get email about changes, but my notification preferences
aren't showing up under my account.

* Display preferences
 * Columns in DocumentType selection
 * TopicColumns for Addition
 * Topic columns for list
 * Author Columns
