<font size=+3>Certificate Issues</font>
</center>
<p>
<ol>
<li> If you wish to use more than one type of certificate 
     (for instance, both KCA and DOEGrid certificates), 
     each certificate type will need to be separately registered with DocDB.
     <ul>
     <li>To minimize confusion, we strongly recommend that you choose only one 
     certificate type for access.  
     <li>We recommend that Fermilab and other Kerberos 
     users choose the Kerberos (KCA) certificate.  This is more secure and will, 
     at least at Fermilab, be required for access to other web sites.
     </ul>
<li> Every browser handles multiple certificates differently.
     <ul>
     <li>IE will ask you which certificate you want to use.
     <li>Mozilla and Firefox will attempt to present the appropriate
         certificate to the server.    
     Unfortunately, this may not be the one you want.
     The only way around this is to configure Mozilla or Firefox to always
     ask you which certificate to use.  
     This will quickly get old, so you probably only want a single certificate
     in your browser.  
     <li>  A bit of explanation may be in order.  
           The web server has a list of acceptable certificate types.
	   Your browser returns one of these acceptable certificates.  
	   If you only have one acceptable certificate type,
	   there is no confusion.  If, however, you have more than
	   one acceptable certificate, the browser does not automatically
	   know which one to use.
     </ul>
<li> MacOSX Safari seems to have problems with certificates. 
</ol>
