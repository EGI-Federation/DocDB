<h1>Help for posting a BTeV Document</h1>


    <P>You should already have requested a number for this Note.  
    If you haven't, just follow the link provided to request one.
    If a number has been assigned, but you have forgotten it or need 
    to check the Notes database for any reason, follow the link 
    provided for searching the database.

    <P>If this is a revised version of an already-posted Note, click 
    "YES" for "Is this a revised version?". You can change the
	      document type when you post a revision. If you want to
	      do this then select NO to the question "Is this the same
	      document type as before". The default is that the types
	      are the same. If you selected NO then the directory
	      containing the previous revision will be removed.

    <P>Provide the full pathname for the abstract (text) file and for 
      the document, which must be one of the types listed, any other
      type will fail.
      The files must be located on the machine where 
      you are running your web browser. If you don't remember the filename then
      a Browse button is provided. You must specify both and abstract file and 
      a document file.

<p> Various formats of documents are supported. You can post text
	      files, html files, Powerpoint files, Postscript files,
	      PDF files and MSWord files. <span class=red>In the interests of making
	      the documents as readable by as many people as possible
	      you are encouraged to convert MSWord files to Postscript 
	      or PDF.</span>

    <P>Your files will be uploaded to the BTeV webserver and checked for 
    filetype and to make sure they are not empty files. They will then be
    copied to the document area and the catalog will be updated. Mail will
    be sent to the btev-notes mailing list announcing the posting. If
	      you are not on this mailing list and would like to get
	      notifications then please do the following:
<ol>
<li> Send an e-mail to <a
		  href="mailto:listserv@fnal.gov">listserv@fnal.gov</a>
<li> Leave the subject blank
<li> Type <span class=red>SUBSCRIBE BTEV-NOTES YOURFIRSTNAME YOURLASTNAME</span> in the body of your
		message
</ol>

<p>
Conversely if you would like to remove yourself from this list then
	    do the following :

<ol>
<li> Send an e-mail to <a
		  href="mailto:listserv@fnal.gov">listserv@fnal.gov</a>
<li> Leave the subject blank
<li> Type <span class=red>UNSUBSCRIBE BTEV-NOTES</span> in the body of your
		message
</ol>


      <p> A common problem with posting is not having the correct
      match between file suffixes and MIMEtypes set in your
      browser. For example for a PDF file the suffix should be pdf and 
      the MIMEtype should be application/pdf. Any other combination
      will cause the upload to fail. If you have problems uploading
      files, for example you get an error that tells you you didn't
      upload a PDF file when you know you did then these settings are
      probably the culprit. To check the MIMEtypes do the
      following:<p>

<h3> Netscape - both Linux and Windows</h3>
    <p>On the Edit menu -&gt Preferences -&gt Navigator -&gt
      Applications<br>
Select the application and click the edit button. You can then
      check/change the MIMEtype and file suffixes.<br>
      If the document type is not listed at all then select New
      and create the entry for the application.


<h3> Internet Explorer </h3>
<p>
<h4> Windows versions before 2000</h4>
<p> From the Control Panel window run Folder Options and select File
      Types. Select the application type from the list and chose
      Edit. Check the Content-type and file extension and change if
      necessary and save the entry. If the entry is not there then
      select New and create a new entry.<p>
<h4> Windows 2000 </h4>
<p>It appears that in Windows 2000 there is no option to set the mime 
      type, it is determined by the operating system.
<p>

Here is the list for the types supported by the BTeV Document Database (there may
      be additional suffixes listed in your browser - that is okay). Note
      that in Multiples File Uploads you may include other types of
      files in the tar file but the main document must be one of the
      supported formats.<p>
