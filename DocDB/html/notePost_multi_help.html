<h1>Help for posting a Multiple File BTeV Document</h1>

    <P>You should already have requested a number for this Note.  
    If you haven't, just follow the link provided to request one.
    If a number has been assigned, but you have forgotten it or need 
    to check the Notes database for any reason, follow the link 
    provided for searching the database.</p>

    <P>If this is a revised version of an already-posted Note, click 
    "YES" for "Is this a revised version?". </P>

    <P>Provide the full pathname for the abstract (text) file and for 
      the tar file or gzipped tar file.
      The files must be located on the machine where 
      you are running your web browser. If you don't remember the filename then
      a Browse button is provided. You must specify both and abstract file and 
      a tar file.</P>

      <h3>Preparing your tar file</h3>
<p>The only format that is excepted for Multiple File Uploads is a tar 
      file or a gzipped tar file if you are transferring a large
      file. The tar files should consist of your primary document plus 
      any supporting files. </P>

      <p>The primary document must be one of the accepted types of
      document, ps, pdf, doc, ppt, txt, html. The supporting files may 
      be ps, pdf, doc, ppt, txt, xls, gif, jpeg, eps, jpg. They should 
      be created with these file extensions. Other types may be added
      on request. </P>

<p>Create the tar file:<br>
<br>
<h4>UNIX</h4>

<p>
% tar -cvf my.tar my.doc fig1.ps fig2.ps<br>
% gzip my.tar (this is optional)
</P>

<h4>Windows</h4><p>

Launch the Tar program on your Windows machine and create the tar
archive. 
</P>

<p>
If you want to gzip your tar file you will need one of the compression 
tools such as WinZip.</P>

<p>
You can now upload your tar file. You must specify the name of the
    primary document in the tar file, this would be my.doc in the
    example above.</P>

<h3>What happens to your files?</h3>

    <P>Your files will be uploaded to the BTeV webserver and checked for 
    filetype and to make sure they are not empty files. The tar file
      will then be
    copied to the document area and unwound. The files will be renamed 
      and some of them will be compressed to save space. The catalog
      will be updated. Mail will
    be sent to the BTEV-NOTES mailing list announcing the posting.</p>

<h3>Special instructions if your primary document is an HTML file</h3>

<p> You should create the main html file with file extension html. All 
      links in the document that refer to files that you plan to
      upload with the main html file should be relative links. This
      means that if your file is my.html and you want to include a
      link to fig1.ps you should specify it as &lt A HREF="fig1.ps"
      &gt. Other external links should be made as usual.</p>

<p> Create the tar file as described above. When the tar file is
      unwound on the server it will ONLY rename the main document,
      which means that your links will work provided you made them relative.</P>
