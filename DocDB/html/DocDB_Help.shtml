<h3>Philosophy of the BTeV Document Database</h3>

While our previous document database was only a method for cataloging
documents, the new database goes one step further; it is also a method for
storing documents in a central location. So, you should never again see a
broken link while looking for the information you want. This distinction is
especially important when archive uploads which are discussed later. <p>

<h3>What do you want to do?</h3>

You can add information or documents to the database in five different ways for
five different situations:
<ol>
<li><b>Reserve a document #: </b>You want a number for a document
you are going to write, but don't have a draft of the document.
<li><b>New document: </b>You have a new document ready to be put into the
database that has not been entered before.
<li><b>Update document: </b>You have a new version of a document already in the
database. You will also be able to change any of the information in the
database about the document. You must supply a document number to modify.
<li><b>Update database information: </b>The document hasn't changed, but the
information about it has. For example, it's now published so you want to add
that information. You must supply a document number to modify.
<li><b>Add files to document:</b> Perhaps you forgot a file initially, or maybe
now you have a Postscript file to go with the Power Point and PDF files already
present. Then, you can add a file to an existing version of a document. If the
content has changed at all, you should use the Update, not the Add file, option.
</ol>
Select the type of modification appropriate to your situation. 

<h3>Preparing your document for the document database</h3>

If your document just consists of one file, say a PDF, and its on the computer
you are using or accessible by the web, you are prepared. Better yet, you will
probably be able to use one of the shortcuts in the middle of the page. Skip
ahead to the next section.
<p>
If your document is in several pieces, say a bunch of HTML files or a
PowerPoint, a PDF, and a Postscript, you have a decision to make. Do you want
to specify each file you want to upload or do you want to make everything into
an archive (like a .tar or .zip file) and upload that? In either case, you'll
have to use the advanced form at the bottom of the Document Database web page.

<dl>
<dt><h4>Multiple file uploads</h4>

<dd>In our example of a PowerPoint, a PDF, and a Postscript, this is probably
the right choice. When you upload things this way, it might be a little bit
more work, but what the end user will see is usually clearer. To upload your
file this way, select "Multiple files" under "Upload Type" and type the number
of files in your document in the box that says "# of files." The pros of using
this upload method are that you get to describe each of your documents and that
you don't have to spend time preparing and archive.<p>

When using multiple file upload, you should also understand the concept of Main
and supporting files. Main files are typically the ones you want people to look
at. As an example, the top file of several linked HTML files is a "Main" file,
the others are "Other" files. By default, only the first file uploaded is a
"Main" file. To mark additional files as "Main" check the appropriate boxes.

<dt><h4>Archive uploads</h4>

<dd>Another way to upload multiple files is to place all the files into an
archive. Currently accepted formats are .tar (Unix tape archives), .tar.gz/.tgz
(compressed .tar files), and .zip (Windows ZIP files). To use this option,
select "Archive Upload" under "Upload Type." When you upload your archive you
will be asked for two pieces of information. You will be asked for the filename
of the main file in the archive and to describe that file. Through that one
file, the user should be able to access the other files. For this reason, this
uploaded file should probably be HTML. The pros of this method are that
you don't have to describe or enter every file in the form.

When uploading via archive mode, the Main file will be marked as such and the
entire archive will be marked as an "Other" file.

<dl>
<dt><h5>Note on HTML uploads</h5>

<dd>Remember that the purpose of the document database is to store your
<i>complete</i> document. If you have a number of HTML pages all linked
together, things will appear to "work" just fine if you only upload the first
one. There is no mechanism to prevent you from doing this. However, please
don't do this. Upload all the files so that they <i>all</i> reside on the
server, including images. To
make the links in your HTML work on the server, use links like
<pre>
&lt;a href="myotherpage.html"&gt; or &lt;a href="mysubdir/myotherpage.html"&gt; 
</pre>
rather than 
<pre>
&lt;a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/myotherpage.html"&gt;
</pre>
since in the second form, your document will still point outside of the database
server to files which may disappear.
</dl>

<h3>Upload methods</h3>
 
Once your document is prepared, you have one more decision to make. How do you
want to get the file(s) to the document database? You have two choices:

<ol>
<li>You can upload files from your local computer. In this case, you will get
boxes to type the file names into and (probably) a "Browse" button that will
allow you to pick the file from a list. (How this happens depends on your
browser and operating system.) 
<li>You can upload files by supplying a URL. You have to make sure the files
are accessible from the web, but they can be password protected (you will have
to supply the password). You will have to specify the full URL, including the
"http://" or "https://" at the beginning and a filename at the end (you may not
end the URL with "/"). Currently "https://" (secure upload) does not work, but
we hope this will change in the near future.
</ol>

<h3>Other options</h3>
 
The advanced form provides a few other options that might be useful.  

<p>
<b>Topic Selection: </b>
You can either select the subtopic(s) for your document from one long list (the
current default) or from a number of shorter lists split up by topic. 

<p>
<b>Overriding the submission date: </b>
Use this option to set the date and time for a document written in the past.
Unless you are submitting a document from the old database or one written 
some time ago, you should probably not select this option. By default, new documents
are entered with the current date and time.

<h3>Getting more help</h3>

You can often get more help when using the entry form and the advanced form on
the main page by clicking on the terms in the form. A window will pop up to
explain what is going on.<p>
