<h2>E. How the DocDB matches your entries with documents</h2>

In addition to the moderator associating talks as described above, there are two other ways this can
happen. The first way is to have the user themselves match the talks. The second way is to have the
DocDB guess.<p>

A suggested course of action for the moderator is to first encourage users to match their talks as
described below. Then let the DocDB guess and, as the moderator, confirm its correct guesses, let it
guess again, and only then confirm its correct guesses or correct its incorrect ones. 

<a name="userentry">
<h3>1. User selects the talk</h3>

When a user follows the link at the top of a session or meeting display that says "Add a talk to this
meeting of conference," they will see a document entry form with one small addition: A menu to select
his or her talk from the list of talks for that meeting or session that have not yet been entered.
When the user selects his or her talk from this list, it is entered into the agenda as a confirmed
talk, just as if the moderator had followed the instructions above.

<a name="hinting">
<h3>2. DocDB selects based on hints</h3>

As a last resort the DocDB will try to figure out which agenda entry matches which document.To do
this, the DocDB will construct a list of documents which might match the entries in the agenda. It
will then compare each of those documents against the items in the agenda and pick what it thinks is
the best document among them. This document becomes an unconfirmed match with the entry in the
agenda. If it guesses right, confirm the document as mentioned above.<p>

The list of documents to check against comes from two sources. First documents with modification
times in a time window around the meeting dates are considered. Second, if the meeting is associated
with a topic (discussed above), documents associated with that topic are considered.<p>

Documents are matched with the agenda entries using a scoring system that takes into account several
criteria:
<ul>
<li>Whether the document is associated with the meeting topic</li>
<li>If the document's topics match those in the agenda</li>
<li>If the document's authors match those in the agenda</li>
<li>How well the title of the document matches the suggested title in the agenda (not yet
implemented)</li>
<ul>
 
So, documents that are associated with the meeting topic receive a bonus over documents that just
happen to fall in the time window. Points are also assigned to documents for each author or topic
that matches those suggested in the agenda. For each agenda entry/document pair, a score is
calculated and the document with the highest score is entered as the unconfirmed match. When
documents are confirmed, they are removed from consideration, which may change which assignments the
DocDB makes.<p>

The precise algorithm used in choosing the best match can be determined by looking at the DocDB code.
