<a name="intro">
<h2>A. Introduction</h2>

These instructions refer to a "moderator," but this is just any user with any
valid password who is organizing a meeting. Several people can collaborate to
organize a meeting, but some care must be taken not to overwrite changes with the
web forms.

The meeting organizer system provides the ability to set up meetings with
arbitrary numbers of sessions and breaks and order those sessions and breaks.
With each session, a moderator can set up an arbitrary number of talks and
small breaks, discussion sessions, etc. Those talks are also ordered. Each talk
has a running time, each session a starting time. This, creates an agenda.
Anything from an afternoon video conference to conferences with parallel and
plenary sessions can be organized this way.

<a name="create">
<h2>B. Creating a New Meeting</h2>

The first step in creating a meeting is to set up the sessions in the meeting.
You begin this process by clicking on "Create a New Meeting." Meetings can be
created as a subtopic in the DocDB or, for smaller meetings (perhaps by small
subgroups of people), not as a subtopic. Whether the moderator choose to create
a topic or not, all the functionality of the meeting organizer is still
available. A list of the topics which are designated as "meeting-like" are
shown; simply select one of these to create the subtopic.<p/>

The "Show All Talks" selection does just that. In the default view the user
sees, either all the talks for a meeting can be shown or just links to the
various sessions. This should probably be checked for meetings with just a few
sessions, but left unchecked for larger meetings.<p/>

Space is provided to provide both long and short descriptions of the meeting.
If the meeting is being created with a topic, both of these descriptions are
used. If a topic is not being created, only the long description is used. Also
provided are spaces to specify a location and URL for the conference or meeting
along with the start and stop dates.<p/>

The boxes labeled Meeting Preamble and Epilogue provide a space for text which
will be placed at the top and bottom respectively of the display of the
meeting. <p/>

An identical looking form is used for modifying meeting information.  

<a name="sessions">
<h2>C. Creating Sessions</h2>

On the same form used for creating or modifying a meeting, the moderator is able
to set up one or more sessions in the meetings. If there are not enough spaces
for all the needed sessions, don't worry. Blank slots will be added when
"Submit" is pressed.<p/>

The order these sessions can be
displayed in can be changed by entering new numbers in the Order column.
Decimal numbers are OK, so entering "1.5" will place the session between those
currently numbered "1" and "2." <p/>

Sessions are designated as "Breaks" which cannot have talks associated with
them. Breaks are used for entering meals, breaks, and other activities.<p/>

Existing talks can be deleted by checking the delete box. <p/>

For each session or break, a location (such as a room number) and starting time should be entered. A
title session should also be entered and a longer description of the session
(such as an explanation of the topics covered) may be entered.<p/>

Once at least one session has been added to the meeting, talks can be associated
with the sessions.<p/>

<a name="talks">
<h2>D. Adding and Modifying Talks in a Session</h2>

To modify the talks in a session, either click on the "Modify Session" link
in the navigation bar on the "Display Session" page or the "Modify Talks" link
on the "Modify Meeting" page. This allows the moderator to add as many talks or
breaks as needed. In this context, breaks could be announcements, discussions,
coffee breaks during a session, etc. Any activity which won't have a document
attached to it.<p/>

To create an agenda, the moderator should enter as much information as needed
about each talk or break. The fields are described below. While there are a
finite number of open slots for talks, more are added each time "Submit" is
pressed.

<a name="basicinfo">
<h3>1. Entering basic talk information</h3>

For each talk, at least a suggested title, and time (length) should be entered.
A note on each talk can also be entered, but these are only visible when
clicking on the "Note" link in the meeting or session displays. 

<a name="order">
<h3>2. Ordering the talks</h3>

On the far left is the document order within the session. To reorder talks
within the session, just input new numbers and press "Submit." Decimal numbers
are allowed, so entering "1.5" will place that talk between current talks "1"
and "2." 

<a name="confirm">
<h3>3. Specifying, deleting, and confirming documents</h3>

On the form there are places to enter the document number of a talk if the
moderator already knows it, to confirm a suggestion by the DocDB, and to delete
the entry for a talk entirely. (This will NOT delete the document from the
database, just the entry for the meeting.)

<a name="hints">
<h3>4. Giving hints about the talks</h3>

Finally, the moderator may enter the suggested authors and topics for the talks
to be given. This has two purposes. First, before documents are entered into
the DocDB, attendees can see what the proposed agenda is. Secondly, this
assists the DocDB in finding the correct matches as described below.

<a name="matching">
<h2>E. How the DocDB matches your entries with documents</h2>

In addition to the moderator associating talks as described above, there are
two other ways this can happen. The first way is to have the user themselves
match the talks. The second way is to have the DocDB guess.<p/>

A suggested course of action for the moderator is to first encourage users to
match their talks as described below. Then let the DocDB guess and, as the
moderator, confirm its correct guesses, let it guess again, and only then
confirm its correct guesses or correct its incorrect ones. 

<a name="userentry">
<h3>1. User selects the talk</h3>

When a user follows the link at the top of a session or meeting display that says "Add a talk to this
meeting of conference," they will see a document entry form with one small addition: A menu to select
his or her talk from the list of talks for that meeting or session that have not yet been entered.
When the user selects his or her talk from this list, it is entered into the agenda as a confirmed
talk, just as if the moderator had followed the instructions above.

<a name="hinting">
<h3>2. DocDB selects based on hints</h3>

As a last resort the DocDB will try to figure out which agenda entry matches
which document.To do this, the DocDB will construct a list of documents which
might match the entries in the agenda. It will then compare each of those
documents against the items in the agenda and pick what it thinks is the best
document among them. This document becomes an unconfirmed match with the entry
in the agenda. If it guesses right, confirm the document as mentioned above.<p/>

The list of documents to check against comes from two sources. First documents
with modification times in a time window around the meeting dates are
considered. Second, if the meeting is associated with a topic (discussed
above), documents associated with that topic are considered.<p/>

Documents are matched with the agenda entries using a scoring system that takes into account several
criteria:
<ul>
<li>Whether the document is associated with the meeting topic</li>
<li>If the document's topics match those in the agenda</li>
<li>If the document's authors match those in the agenda</li>
<li>How well the title of the document matches the suggested title in the
agenda (not yet implemented)</li>
<ul>
 
So, documents that are associated with the meeting topic receive a bonus over
documents that just happen to fall in the time window. Points are also assigned
to documents for each author or topic that matches those suggested in the
agenda. For each agenda entry/document pair, a score is calculated and the
document with the highest score is entered as the unconfirmed match. When
documents are confirmed, they are removed from consideration, which may change
which assignments the DocDB makes.<p/>

The precise algorithm used in choosing the best match can be determined by
looking at the DocDB code.
